# AMD Interactive Streaming SDK

AMD Interactive Streaming SDK is a C++ library that provides building blocks and samples for low latency streaming applications, such as Cloud Game Streaming, Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI),
Virtual and Augmented Reality, etc. using AMD Radeon graphics. It allows you to build a complete streaming solution including video and audio capture, video and audio encoder/decoder/pre-post-processing pipelines, a robust and secure network stack, or use some of its components, while implementing the rest yourself.
